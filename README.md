# Procurement Alpha — Strategic Spend & Vendor Optimization
### A Strategic Case Study in identifying EGP 17 Million in lost savings through procurement consolidation and vendor discount optimization.

## 📌 Project Overview
#### This project analyzes a total annual spend of EGP 202.4 Million to identify structural inefficiencies in purchasing behavior. By analyzing over 15,000 transactions across 70 vendors, I identified that the organization is losing significant capital due to a declining discount rate and a high volume of unmanaged "small-bill" transactions.

#### The objective was to transform these insights into a roadmap for the procurement department to recapture lost value and stabilize vendor relations.

## 📊 Strategic Insights (The "So What?")
#### The analysis uncovered three critical areas where data-driven intervention can save the organization millions:

1. The EGP 17 Million Opportunity Loss

- The Gap: While the organization achieved an average discount of 24%, the market-optimal rate was 30.5%.

- The Trend: The "Opportunity Loss %" is escalating quarter-over-quarter (from 5.5% in Q1 to 7% in Q4), signaling that purchasing power is weakening over time.

2. The "Small-Bill" Erosion

- The Problem: I identified 6,273 individual bills under EGP 25,000.

- The Impact: These small transactions account for EGP 16.2 Million in spend but only achieved a 16% discount (significantly lower than the 24% average).

- Recommendation: Consolidating these into bulk quarterly contracts would immediately unlock ~EGP 1.3M in additional savings.

3. The End-of-Month Surge

- Observation: Data visualization of daily spend shows a predictable, massive spike in purchasing during the final days of each month.

- Consultant Insight: This suggests "rushed buying" to meet internal targets, which destroys negotiation leverage with suppliers. Moving to an even distribution would improve cash flow and price positioning.
